<h2>Overview :</h2>
<p align="left">This project aims to build a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system leverages various Python packages such as numpy, pandas, ast, sklearn, and nltk for data processing, feature extraction, and natural language processing. Additionally, streamlit is used for developing a user-friendly web application to interact with the recommendation system.</p>
